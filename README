This directory contains the source code for the Plan 9 VMware tools,
which were written circa 2001 and only ever released in binary form
due to concerns about the proprietary nature of the VMware interface.

Now that the VMware backdoor is published and documented in other
open source code, it is long past overdue to publish these sources.
